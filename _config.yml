            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
